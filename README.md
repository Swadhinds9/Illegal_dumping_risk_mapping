Machine learning-based detection of environmental risk zones from illegal dump sites in Khulna, Bangladesh


Abstract
Illegal dumping is a major challenge of municipal solid waste management. A significant portion of waste is being dumped illegally throughout the city. This improper waste disposal creates serious ecological degradation, environmental hazards, public health risks, and urban planning challenges. This study presents a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning framework for detecting illegal dumping sites (IDS) in Khulna using GeoAI. Seven machine learning algorithms were trained on 70% of 341 confirmed IDS locations across 10m*10m resolution grids covering the study area. The remaining 30% data were reserved for independent testing. Model performance was evaluated using both a hold-out test set and spatial cross-validation. The best model was selected using the weighted AUC-F1 score computed from spatial cross-validation, and the selected best model (RF) was then evaluated on the independent hold-out test set. RF achieved the highest AUC (0.883) and F1 (0.820) as well as performed better across all weighting schemes. Key predictors of IDS were roads, drains and buildings. The predicted risk level shows that the very high and high risk zones are concentrated along roads and urban centers. This study introduces the first GeoAI framework for illegal dumping site detection in Khulna, Bangladesh. This methodology can help municipal authorities to develop a waste management plan that addresses both immediate illegal disposal challenges and long-term infrastructure planning.
